## How to Play Space Adventure

You will be flying through a busy asteroid belt in your spaceship, and your goal is to survive for a given amount of time without crashing into a comet or asteroid. Your ship begins flying through empty space, but obstacles soon start approaching from the top of the screen.

## Controls:

- In the START screen, press 'start' (enter) to begin the round.
- In the MENU screen, use the left and right D-pad (arrow keys) to select difficulty, and select 'start' (enter) to continue. Changing the difficulty will change the time limit of the game as well as the speed of certain obstacles.
- To play the game: Use the D-pad (arrow keys) to steer your ship right, left, up, and down as it flies through space avoiding obstacles.
- If the timer in the bottom-left corner of the screen reaches 00 you win the game. If you get hit by a flying asteroid or comet before the timer reaches 00, then you lose the game.
